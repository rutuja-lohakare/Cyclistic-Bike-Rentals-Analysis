# Cyclistic: Bike Rentals Analysis

## Background
The project is a part of the Google Data Analytics Certification course capstone. The scenario involves analysis of the trip data of the Cyclistic bike share company.

The company has two models for availing service: individual passes which are called "casual" riders and annual subscriptions called "member" riders. The company operates in Chicago with around 6000 bicycles at 700 stations.

Maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth as it ensures financial sustainability and customer retention. The insights can help devise effective marketing strategies aimed to convert more casual riders into annual members.


## Dataset
I had used Cyclistic’s historical trip data to analyze and identify trends. You can download the previous 12 months of Cyclistic trip data here. (Note: The datasets have a different name because Cyclistic is a fictional company. For the purposes of this case study, the datasets are appropriate and will enable you to answer the business questions. The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under this license.)

## Business Task
Objective : To clean, analyze and visualize the data to observe how casual riders use the bike rentals differently from annual member riders.
 
Tools: R for data cleaning and data visualization.

Dataset: Cyclistic’s historical trip data from December 2021 to November 2022
