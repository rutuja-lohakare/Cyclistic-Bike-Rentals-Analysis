# Google Data Analytics Capstone Project: Cyclistic bike-share analysis


## Dataset
I had used Cyclistic’s historical trip data to analyze and identify trends. You can download the previous 12 months of Cyclistic trip data here. (Note: The datasets have a different name because Cyclistic is a fictional company. For the purposes of this case study, the datasets are appropriate and will enable you to answer the business questions. The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under this license.)

## Business Task
Aim: To analyse rider's usage patterns for marketing membership conversion programs.
Tools: R for data cleaning and data visualization.
Dataset: Cyclistic’s historical trip data from December 2021 to November 2022
